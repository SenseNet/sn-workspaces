You may install this component even if you only have the **sensenet ECM Services** main component installed. That way you'll get only the specialized workspace types like *DocumentWorkspace* or *SalesWorkspace* and their content template structure.

If you also have the **sensenet ECM WebPages** component installed (which gives you a UI framework built on *ASP.NET WebForms* on top of sensenet ECM), you'll also get UI elements for workspaces:

- rich workspace content templates
- workspace dashboards
- content list views for libraries and lists

The install package of this component also contains a **demo content structure** that you can import optionally at install time or later.
